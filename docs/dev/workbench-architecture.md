# Workbench Architecture

Status: B020 dev-infrastructure snapshot.

This is the scaffolded architecture for the workbench-first path. B020
delivers only infrastructure and guardrails; business features begin in
later batches.

```

## Backend

- FastAPI app factory in `workbench/backend/workbench_api/app.py`.
- Single B020 route: `GET /health`.
- `workbench/backend/workbench_api/settings.py` uses an explicit env-var
  allowlist. In B020 the allowlist is empty.
- Backend binds to `127.0.0.1` for local-only dev use.
- Tests are split into unit and safety guards.

## Frontend

- Next.js App Router scaffold in `workbench/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`.
- Placeholder home page renders scaffold status plus the canonical
  disclaimer.
- Canonical disclaimer text lives in `workbench/frontend/src/lib/disclaimer.ts`.
- `workbench/frontend/src/types/api.ts` is generated from backend
  OpenAPI via `scripts/generate-types.sh`.
- Vitest covers unit and safety checks.
- Playwright covers the minimal B020 browser smoke path.

## Safety boundaries

The B020 safety tests guard the current no-go surfaces:

- No broker SDK imports in backend or frontend.
- No paper/live broker URLs in backend source.
- No implicit environment-variable reads outside the allowlist.
- Canonical disclaimer visible on every navigable frontend route.

These are hard-boundary checks, not feature regression checks.

## CI

- `workbench-backend.yml` runs backend lint, type-check, unit tests, and
  safety guards.
- `workbench-frontend.yml` runs frontend lint, type-check, Vitest,
  OpenAPI drift detection, and Playwright smoke tests.
- `python-ci.yml` remains separate and continues to protect `trade/`.

## Batch boundary

- B021 adds cloud deploy and auth.
- B022 adds the first real workbench product surface.
- B023 adds the manual execution UI.

Do not move cloud, auth, or business logic into B020.
